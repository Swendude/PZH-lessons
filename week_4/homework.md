NB: 
- I forgot to mention this during the lesson but the `in` operator check if an item is in a list (and returns a Bool ofcourse).
- The .remove() operation removes an item if it matches the argument.
i.e.:
```python
x = [3, 1, 2]
print(1 in x) #True
print(4 in x) #False
x.remove(3) # removes the 3 from the list
print(x) # [1, 2]
```

## Question 1:
What do the following operations return? What is the returned object's type?
```python
fruits = ['Tomato', 'Pumpkin', 'Cucumber', 'Eggplant']
animals = ['Dog', 'Whale', 'Crow', 'Snake']
mammals = ['Dog', 'Whale', 'Cat']
 
i1 = fruits[2]
i2 = fruits[-1]
i3 = fruits[2 + 1]
i4 = animals[5]
i5 = animals[0] in mammals
i6 = fruits[1:2]
i7 = fruits[:4]
i8 = fruits[-2:] 
i9 = animals[-5:]
i10= fruits[::2]
i11= fruits[::3]
i11= fruits[1::2]
i12= fruits[2:3] in fruits[2:]
i13= fruits.append("Orange")
```
## Question 2:
What are the current contents of the list with variable name 'fruits?
 
## Question 3:
What does fruits look like at the end of these commands?
```python
fruits.sort()
fruits[1:]
schaap = fruits.pop()
fruits.pop(len(fruits) - 1)
fruits.append(schaap)# fruits.append('schaap')
if "Eggplant" in fruits:
    fruits.remove("Eggplant")
    fruits.sort()
else:
    fruits.reverse()
```
## Question 4
Write a program that prints the fibbonaci sequence until the value exceeds 50.
The fibbonaci sequence is defined as: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...(Add the previous two numbers)
A good starting point is to define the first two values as variables
```python
x = 1
y = 2
``` 
These are the two starting values of the sequence, the next value can be generated by adding these numbers (so the third fibbonaci number is 3)
 
Tips:
- Try to find a repeatable pattern for generating the values in the sequence
- You need a while loop
- You do not need more variables!!
